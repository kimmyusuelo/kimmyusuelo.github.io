            for individuals with diverse interests and skill sets. 
            From software development to data analysis,there are numerous roles within the field that cater to
            different passions and strengths. Additionally, I discovered 
            that the demand for computing professionals is continuously growing,
            making it a promising and stable career choice for the future.</p>

                information processing cycle consists of four stages: input, 
                processing, output, and storage. I learn that During the input stage, 
                data is collected and entered into a computer system. 
                This can be done through various means such as typing on a keyboard, scanning documents, 
                or using sensors to capture data from the environment. The processing stage involves
                manipulating and analyzing the inputted data to produce meaningful results. </p>

                the importance of protecting computer systems and data from 
                unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. 
                I have also gained knowledge about various security measures, 
                such as encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, and user authentication methods.
                Additionally, I have learned about common threats and vulnerabilities that
                can compromise computer security, including malware attacks, phishing scams, 
                social engineering tactics, and weak passwords.</p>

        <div class="des">
            <p>In basic HTML and CSS, I learned that HTML is a markup language used for structuring 
                the content on a webpage, while CSS is a style sheet language used for controlling 
                the presentation and layout of the content. HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage 
                by using tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS, 
                on the other hand, allows you to customize the appearance of these elements by specifying
                properties like color, font size, and positioning. Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation 
                of web development and are essential skills for every developer to learn.</p>

                <p>In this lesson on basic HTML and CSS because it provides 
                    a solid foundation for web development.<br>Learning these fundamental
